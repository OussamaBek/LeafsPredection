# LeafsPredection
This project consists of 2 applications with a graphical interface for defining the class of the photo given as a parameter, one based on the SVC (Support Vector Classification) method and the other on the VGG16 convolutional neural network system.
### Specifications:
The project involves monitoring the health status of flora using image processing and Deep Learning techniques. The application will use 38 image classes to classify the images passed as parameters, so that it can be used to make decisions on the choice of treatment for affected plants. For this project, there are 2 architectures available: the first consists in classifying the images after having the characteristics common to each class with which to compare them (Bags Of Words), the second is based on a version of the well-known convolutional neural network called VGG16, modifying its layers to adapt it to the project in question.
## Devlopment
### Tools from Part 1 :
* Numpy: is a library that facilitates the manipulation of lists, matrices and mathematical functions.
* Matplotlib: a function library for creating figures, histograms, etc.
* Pylab: makes it easy to use the NumPy and matplotlib libraries for scientific programming with Python.
* Os: is a module for interacting with the operating system. In our case, it lets us manage the file tree.
* Cv2: or OpenCV-Python is a library for image manipulation (reading images, extracting features, creating bags of words, etc.).
* Sklearn: is a library for supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
### Part 2 tools:
* Numpy: is a library that facilitates the manipulation of lists, matrices and mathematical functions.
* Matplotlib: is a function library for creating histograms, etc.
* Os: is a module for interacting with the operating system, in our case allowing us to manage the file tree.
* Cv2: or OpenCV-Python is a library for image manipulation (reading images, extracting features, creating bags of words, etc.).
* Tensorflow: is an open source Machine Learning library, created by Google, for developing and running Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications.
* Keras: is a high-level neural network API, written in Python and interfaced with TensorFlow. Keras is a library that : Enables rapid and easy prototyping (thanks to its user-friendliness, modularity and extensibility).
